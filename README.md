__**MacroKeybinds has 4 mode:**__

**You can create macros that will be available in all servers.**  
**However you can create macros for each server, useful when you play on more than one server.**  
**You can assign several macros to the same key.**

 

**Be careful! Some servers do not tolerate this type of mod. Make sure you don't get banned for cheating! I won't be held responsible for your actions.**
